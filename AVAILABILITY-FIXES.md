# Availability Mismatch Fixes

## Problem Description

The MCP server was incorrectly reporting availability data that didn't match the actual calendar availability. Specifically:

**Expected vs Actual for Neha Patil on Monday, August 18, 2025:**
- **Expected**: Available from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM (4 hours completely free)
- **MCP Reported**: "Unavailable" with busy times from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM

**Expected vs Actual for chitsimran_singh on Monday, August 18, 2025:**
- **Expected**: Available during certain time slots
- **MCP Reported**: "Unavailable" with a busy bar from 8:00 AM extending past 4:00 PM

## Root Cause Analysis

The mismatch was caused by **timezone interpretation issues** in the Microsoft Graph API response processing:

1. **Microsoft Graph API returns times in local timezone** (e.g., "2025-08-18T04:00:00.0000000" represents 8:00 AM Dubai time, not 4:00 AM UTC)

2. **JavaScript's Date constructor incorrectly interprets these as UTC** when they don't have explicit timezone indicators

3. **Inconsistent timezone conversion logic** throughout the availability processing pipeline

4. **Double timezone conversion** in some parts of the code

## Specific Issues Fixed

### 1. Timezone Conversion in `processFreeBusy()` Method

**Before**: The method was mixing timezone-aware strings with UTC Date objects, causing comparison errors.

**After**: Consistent timezone handling by converting window boundaries to timezone-aware strings and parsing all times consistently.

### 2. Improved `getFreeBusy()` Method

**Before**: Limited logging and error handling for timezone issues.

**After**: Enhanced logging at each step, better error handling, and consistent timezone conversion.

### 3. Enhanced `formatTimeForOutput()` Method

**Before**: Inconsistent use of `parseGraphAPITime()` function.

**After**: Consistent use of `parseGraphAPITime()` for Microsoft Graph API responses with detailed logging.

### 4. Added Debug Tool

**New**: `debug_availability` tool that provides:
- Raw Microsoft Graph API responses
- Processed availability data
- Timezone conversion details
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Code Changes Made

### `src/scheduling/availability.ts`

1. **Fixed `processFreeBusy()` method**:
   - Consistent timezone handling for window boundaries
   - Proper parsing of item times as timezone-aware dates
   - Fixed comparison logic to avoid double conversion

2. **Enhanced `getFreeBusy()` method**:
   - Added detailed logging for each step
   - Better error handling and fallback logic
   - Consistent timezone conversion throughout

3. **Improved `formatTimeForOutput()` method**:
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Consistent use of `parseGraphAPITime()`
   - Better handling of different time formats

4. **Added `debugAvailability()` method**:
   - Comprehensive debugging tool for availability issues
   - Raw API response inspection
   - Timezone conversion validation

### `src/mcp.ts`

1. **Added `debug_availability` tool**:
   - New MCP tool for diagnosing availability issues
   - Same input schema as `get_availability`
   - Returns detailed debugging information

## Testing

A new test script `test-availability-fixed.js` has been created to test the fixes with the specific date from the images (August 18, 2025).

## How to Use the Fixes

### 1. Test the Fixed Availability

```bash
npm run build
node test-availability-fixed.js
```

### 2. Use the Debug Tool

The new `debug_availability` tool can be used to diagnose any remaining timezone issues:

```json
{
  "name": "debug_availability",
  "arguments": {
    "participants": ["neha.patil@masaood.com", "chitsimran_singh@masaood.com"],
    "windowStart": "2025-08-18T08:00:00+04:00",
    "windowEnd": "2025-08-18T18:00:00+04:00",
    "timeZone": "Asia/Dubai"
  }
}
```

### 3. Monitor Logs

The enhanced logging will now show:
- Raw API responses
- Timezone conversion steps
- Availability processing details
- Any timezone-related issues

## Expected Results

After the fixes:

1. **Neha Patil's availability** should correctly show as available from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM
2. **chitsimran_singh's availability** should show accurate busy/free times
3. **Timezone conversions** should be consistent throughout the pipeline
4. **Debug information** should help identify any remaining issues

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use timezone-aware time handling** when working with Microsoft Graph API
2. **Use the `parseGraphAPITime()` function** for all API response times
3. **Test with real calendar data** in different timezones
4. **Monitor the enhanced logging** for any timezone conversion issues
5. **Use the debug tool** when availability seems incorrect

## Files Modified

- `src/scheduling/availability.ts` - Core availability service fixes
- `src/mcp.ts` - Added debug tool
- `test-availability-fixed.js` - New test script
- `AVAILABILITY-FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes with real calendar data
2. Monitor for any remaining timezone issues
3. Use the debug tool to validate availability accuracy
4. Consider adding automated timezone validation tests
